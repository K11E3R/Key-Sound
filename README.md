## Features

- **4 sound themes** — Mechanical, Typewriter, Bubble, Soft
- **Per-event sounds** — distinct sounds for typing, Enter, Backspace/Delete, Save (Ctrl+S), and Paste
- **Terminal sounds** — plays a sound when you execute a command in the integrated terminal (shell integration)
- **Live equalizer** — animated waveform reacts to every keystroke in real time
- **Session stats** — tracks keys typed, lines added, deletes, and saves
- **Works everywhere in VS Code** — code editors, rename inputs, search boxes, git commit messages

## Getting Started

1. Install the extension from a `.vsix` file:
   - Open the **Extensions** sidebar (`Ctrl+Shift+X`)
   - Click `···` → **Install from VSIX…**
   - Select `key-sound-1.0.0.vsix`

2. The **Key Sound** panel opens automatically in the Activity Bar on first launch.

3. Click **"🎹 Key Sound"** in the Activity Bar any time to open the settings panel.

> **Audio activation:** On first open, the panel audio engine starts automatically. If you see the yellow "audio inactive" warning, click the pill once to activate.

## How It Works

All audio synthesis happens inside a VS Code **Webview** using the built-in **Web Audio API** — no sound files, no native binaries. This means it works seamlessly across:

- WSL / Remote SSH / Dev Containers
- Windows, Linux, and macOS

The extension hooks into:
- The VS Code **`type` command** (one event per keystroke in editors)
- `onDidChangeTextDocument` (deletions, pastes, AI completions)
- `onDidSaveTextDocument` (save chime)
- `window.onDidStartTerminalShellExecution` (fires on Enter/command execution in the terminal)

> **Terminal note:** VS Code's `onDidWriteTerminalData` is a permanently-proposed API and cannot be used by installed extensions. Terminal sounds therefore fire on command execution rather than per-keystroke. Shell integration must be active in the terminal (enabled by default for bash, zsh, fish, PowerShell).

> **General note:** Copilot Chat and other webview panels (browser preview, etc.) are sandboxed by VS Code and cannot be intercepted by any extension.
